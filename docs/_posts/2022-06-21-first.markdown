John quit smoking and decided to improve his health by running marathon back in 2007.  Over the years, he has run more than 50 marathons with a personal best of 2:50. Through meditation from running, each day he appreciates life more deeply. He wants to help other runners to achieve their goals and reach their enlightenments (ah-ha moment of life) through distance running.
