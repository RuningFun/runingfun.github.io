<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
I quit smoking and decided to improve my health by running marathon back in 2007.  Over the years, I have run more than 50 marathons with a personal best of 2:50. Through meditation from running, each day I appreciate life more deeply. I want to help other runners to achieve their goals and reach their enlightenments (ah-ha moment of life) through distance running.
